/*
 * Author: Root
 * Description: Tests whether an open SSH session still has anything on the other end of it, and closes
 * it where it does not. A session is only as good as the conditions it was opened under: the remote
 * machine has to still exist, still be running, still accept SSH, and still be reachable from the local
 * machine over the network as it stands now - a laptop that was shut down, destroyed, packed away, or
 * whose router went off the air is none of those things, and neither is a remote that is still running
 * but no longer on a network this laptop can route to. The same conditions are re-tested rather than
 * trusted from connection time, since every one of them can change while the session sits open. Reports
 * the drop in the local terminal and tears the session down, so a dead session cannot be typed into.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: _computer <OBJECT> - The local computer holding the SSH session
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Alive <BOOL> - true when the session is still good, false when it was closed
 *
 * Example:
 * if (!([_computer] call AE3_armaos_fnc_shell_sshAlive)) exitWith {};
 *
 * Public: No

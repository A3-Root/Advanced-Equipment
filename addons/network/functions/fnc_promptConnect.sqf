 * Author: Root
 * Description: Gate for joining a router from the ACE interaction menu. When the router has no

 * connection is only performed once the correct password is entered
 * (AE3_network_fnc_connectSubmitPassword). Client-side.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: _device <OBJECT> - The device (or router) requesting the connection
 * 1: _router <OBJECT> - The router being joined
 * 2: _connect <CODE> - Connection function called as [_device, _router] call _connect on success
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_device, _router, AE3_network_fnc_connect_device2router] call AE3_network_fnc_promptConnect;
 *
 * Public: No

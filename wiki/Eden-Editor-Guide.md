# Eden Editor Guide

This guide explains how to configure AE3 in 3DEN without scripting. It covers placing objects, opening attributes, using modules, syncing modules, and creating power/network connections.

## Finding AE3 Objects

AE3 objects appear in editor asset categories added by the mod. The exact category names can vary with localization, but the objects include laptops, routers, generators, batteries, solar panels, lights, desks, and flash drives.

Common placed objects:

- AE3 laptop.
- AE3 router variants.
- Portable generators.
- Batteries.
- Solar panels.
- Portable lights.
- Flash drive objects.

## Opening Object Attributes

To configure an AE3 object:

1. Place the object.
2. Double-click it in the 3DEN viewport or entity list.
3. Scroll through the attributes window.
4. Look for AE3-specific fields mixed with the normal Arma attributes.
5. Change the values.
6. Confirm the attribute window.

Object attributes are best for settings that belong to that object: laptop interface mode, static IP, router wireless settings, initial fuel, initial battery level, and powered-on behavior.

## Laptop Attributes

AE3 laptops have object attributes for the computer itself.

Important fields:

- Power level: initial internal battery or power state value where available.
- Interface mode: controls whether players get CLI, GUI, both, or the default interface behavior.
- Static IP: optional fixed IP address for the laptop when connected to a router.
- Software-related attributes: command and laptop setup fields exposed by the laptop class.

Interface mode options:

- Default: use the mission/default setting.
- CLI: terminal command line only.
- GUI: graphical desktop only.
- Both: expose both interfaces.

Use laptop attributes when every player should see the same base behavior from mission start.

## Router Attributes

Routers are configured by double-clicking the router object.

Router fields:

- Network Name (SSID): the name shown for the wireless network. Blank keeps the default object name.
- Default Gateway: optional address for the router. Blank keeps auto-assigned subnet behavior.
- Wifi Range (m): maximum distance for connections.
- Network Password: password required to connect. Blank means open network.
- Power level: initial internal battery/power value where available.
- Powered On At Start: starts the router automatically.
- Allow External SSH: allows ping/SSH from other gateways.
- External Allowed IPs: optional allow list for external sources. Blank allows any source when external access is enabled.

For simple missions, set an SSID, optionally set a password, leave gateway blank, and turn on Powered On At Start.

## Power Device Attributes

Generators, batteries, and solar panels can expose attributes such as:

- Fuel level.
- Battery/power level.
- Powered-on-at-start behavior where supported.

Use these attributes to decide whether players can immediately use equipment or must restore power during the mission.

## 3DEN Connection Tools

AE3 adds custom editor connection types:

- `AE3: connect device to power source`
- `AE3: connect device to network router`

Use these from the 3DEN connection menu, similar to syncing or other editor connection workflows.

### Power Connection

Purpose: connect a powered consumer to a provider.

Typical pairs:

- Laptop to generator.
- Laptop to battery.
- Router to generator.
- Light to generator.
- Battery to solar panel when using a charging setup.

Workflow:

1. Select the connection tool `AE3: connect device to power source`.
2. Start the connection on the device that needs power.
3. End the connection on the generator, battery, or solar panel.
4. Preview the mission and verify the powered device can turn on.

### Network Connection

Purpose: connect a network device to a router.

Typical pairs:

- Laptop to router.
- Router to parent router.

Workflow:

1. Select the connection tool `AE3: connect device to network router`.
2. Start the connection on the laptop or child router.
3. End the connection on the router.
4. Preview the mission.
5. Check that the laptop can use network features when powered.

## Using AE3 Modules

Modules are used to add content or behavior to an object. Most laptop-content modules must be synced to one or more laptops.

General module workflow:

1. Place the target laptop.
2. Place the AE3 module.
3. Double-click the module.
4. Fill in the module fields.
5. Sync the module to the laptop.
6. Preview the mission.
7. Open the laptop as a player and verify the result.

If nothing happens, first check the sync line.

## Laptop Content Modules

These modules are used to populate laptop content.

### AE3: Add User

For normal mission notes, leave Is Code off. Use encryption only when players are expected to solve an encryption/security step.

### AE3: Add Calendar Event

Adds an event to the laptop Calendar app.

Fields:

- Date.

## Special Modules

### AE3: Save Laptop

Use this for scenarios where Zeus or mission flow may need to preserve laptop state.

### AE3: Restore Laptop

Restores a laptop from a named save slot.

Field:

- Save slot.

Sync target:

- AE3 laptop.

Use this to replace a lost or disabled laptop with a saved state.

### AE3: Crash Device

Crashes synced AE3 laptops. A crashed laptop shows crash behavior and must be power-cycled to recover.

Sync target:

Use with triggers or Zeus for sabotage, failed hacking, or scripted incident moments.

## Module Syncing

To sync a module:

1. Select the module.
2. Use the standard 3DEN sync connection.
3. Drag the sync line to the target laptop or object.
4. Confirm the line remains visible.

Most AE3 content modules accept a laptop as the synced target. Some modules can be synced to multiple laptops when you want the same content on more than one device.

## Troubleshooting 3DEN Setup

- Module did nothing: check that it is synced to the laptop.
- File is missing: check that the folder path exists or add the folder first.
- Browser history opens nowhere: check that the matching webpage exists.
- Players cannot open GUI: check laptop Interface Mode and access restrictions.
- Players cannot use terminal: check laptop Interface Mode and installed commands.
- Network tools fail: check router power, router range, password, and connection line.
- Device will not turn on: check power source, connection direction, fuel, and battery level.
